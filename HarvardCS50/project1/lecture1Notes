Notes on working with terminal to make C file executable

- to do three distinct things: compile, name the output, and link a library.
    ` clang lectureScript2_hello.c -o lectureScript2_hello -lcs50`
    - clang: turns your C code into a runnable program.
    - `-o lectureScript2_hello` Name the compiled program (produces new file)
    - lcs50: link with library name cs50

- before running script, make the file executable via `make filename`
